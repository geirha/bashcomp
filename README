bashcomp loads completions as needed for the commands completions are
written for.

To install, add the content of bashrc to your ~/.bashrc, and
copy/symlink the bashcomp directory as ~/.config/bashcomp 

Note that this is incompatible with the bash-completion package, so if
you have bash-completion installed, make sure you disable it before
enabling this one.
